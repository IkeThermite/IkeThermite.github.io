      <description>Playing Guard Collar-Sleeve and De La Riva Guard Seated Guard $\rightarrow$ Collar Sleeve&amp;#43;The game is about getting a single Straight Sleeve Grip with my left hand. Everything comes from there.
 Establish left hand Straight Cuff Grip. Fall back immediately. Right foot to bicep, left foot takes Half Lasso (in front of neck). Goal is to get his gripped hand above my hips. Now the left foot can safely unwind and go to the hip.</description>

<article class="markdown"><h1 id="john-danaher---go-further-faster-volume-6---passing-the-guard">John Danaher - Go Further Faster Volume 6 - Passing the Guard</h1>
<p>Fundamental Guard Passes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double Under Pass</li>
<li>Over Under Pass</li>
<li>Knee Cut Pass</li>
<li>Toreando Pass</li>
<li>Leg Drag</li>
<li>Long Step Pass</li>
<li>Smash Pass</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nomenclature">Nomenclature</h2>
<ul>
<li>Centerline: The line that bisects my opponent's left and right side.</li>
<li>Left Diagonal: The line that runs from my opponent's right shoulder to his left hip.</li>
<li>Right Diagonal: The line that runs from my opponent's left shoulder to his right hip.</li>
<li>Kneeline: The line that connects my opponent's left and right knee.</li>
<li>Toeline: The line that connects the toes of my opponent's left and right foot.</li>
<li>Hipline: The line that connects my opponent's left and right hip bone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Grips are described as follows:
<code>(Left | Right) (Straight | Cross) [High | Mid | Low] (Location)</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>(Left | Right)</code> refers to which hand I am gripping with.</li>
<li><code>(Straight | Cross | Center)</code> refers to whether or not the grip crosses my opponent's centerline. A straight grip is a &ldquo;near side&rdquo; grip, not crossing the centerline. A center grip is on the centerline. A cross grip is a &ldquo;far side&rdquo; grip, which crosses the centerline.</li>
<li><code>[High | Mid | Low]</code> optionally refers to where the grip is placed on the <code>(Location)</code>.</li>
<li><code>(Location)</code> refers to which part of my opponent's body or gi I am gripping.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-double-under-pass">The Double Under Pass</h2>
<ul>
<li>Challenge is always to pass someone's guard while they are attacking you.</li>
<li>Double Under position negates most attacks and most major forms of open guard (tremendous shutdown effect).</li>
</ul>
<p>Trigger:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exposed hamstrings. If I can see my partner's hamstrings, I can drop to the Double Under position. If I cannot expose his hamstrings (get his feet higher than his knees), I have to change passes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technique:</strong><br>
<em>Training partner is on his back, knees tucked to his chest, heels pulled to his buttocks. I'm standing, approaching the guard.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Step forward, but stay outside opponent's Toe Line.</li>
<li>Grip the soles of his feet (thumb in soles grip) and run his feet over his head, pointing them at the ceiling. Do NOT expose sleeve cuffs to opponent! Alternative: Grip underneath his Achilles tendons.</li>
<li>Pinch with my knees and drop down to Double Under grips, but form a slight angle to his body (shift to my right). Back of his left knee must be on my shoulder.</li>
<li>First concern is alignment with his Left Diagonal. To anchor to this line, I grab his far lapel with my right hand, just below the line of his pectorals (Right Cross Mid Lapel Grip).</li>
<li>Tuck my elbow tightly into his body, difficult for him to expose it and start his guard retention. <em>Note that this is a tradeoff between elbow exposure and head control.</em></li>
<li>My right knee stays on the mat as I drive off my left foot (raising my left knee).</li>
<li>Take Left Center Drawstring grip.</li>
<li>Bring left knee as a wedge behind partner's lower back. My head is directly over his head; this negates his Shoulder Walk counter.
<ul>
<li><strong>CHECKPOINT:</strong> Plough Position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Move right hand to Right Cross High Lapel Grip to gain head control.</li>
<li>Start driving hips forward by taking my right knee off the floor and arch my body.</li>
<li>Bring right elbow over his head and settle down into Modified Side Control.</li>
</ol>
<p>Full Technique Run Through: Disc 3 00:15:05</p>
<p><strong>Alternative - Advanced Variation:</strong><br>
<em>I have Double Under grips, but can't raise his right leg to my shoulder. Or I can raise his leg, but he is very good at Shoulder Walking backwards.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Bring his left knee to his Centerline and push the opposite knee to the mat. <em>Note: This position is exactly our Stack passing entry series.</em></li>
<li>Duck down (level change) to get it onto my shoulder.</li>
<li>Then raise his hips up just enough that I can bring my left hand to Center Drawstring Grip.</li>
<li>Now lift and bring opponent's toes to the mat.
<ul>
<li><strong>CHECKPOINT:</strong> Plough Position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My opponent can post his left hand on my hip and make it very difficult to drive into him. So instead, I use my head to clear his legs.</li>
<li>Bring my head down to his thigh and drive it across the Hipline to his far hip. Head is a battering ram that turns the corner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Full Technique Run Through: Disc 3 00:24:18</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  <strong>The Centerline</strong><br>
When I am centered with my opponent, he can easily makes his legs very heavy. I want to be aligned with his Left Diagonal.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="book-hint danger">
  <strong>Getting Underneath His Legs</strong><br>
Don't try to swim or pummel underneath his legs with your arms! This will expose you to various types of open guard, i.e., Lasso and Spider variations.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-over-under-pass">The Over Under Pass</h2>
<ul>
<li>Closely connected to Double Under; both work by controlling opponent's hips.</li>
<li>So mechanically efficient and conceptually simple, it doesn't really need combinations.</li>
<li>Open Guard is only effective when my opponent has one knee on each side of his Centerline. With the Over Under Pass, I am moving both knees to one side of his centerline.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Training partner is on his back, knees tucked to his chest, heels pulled to his buttocks. I'm standing, approaching the guard.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Stay outside his Toeline. Left Straight Low Pants Grip. By his ankle, on the outside. To get this grap, slap his foot with my right hand towards my left.</li>
<li>Use the heel of my hand to control his foot.</li>
<li>Right hand posts on his left knee, on the inside.</li>
<li>Drive his heel to his buttocks and step to the left, then in, pinching both my knees over my partner's ankle.</li>
<li>Right hand slides underneath his knee, Scoop Grip, reaching for his belt or gi.</li>
<li>I &ldquo;dive&rdquo; over his trapped knee, sliding my left bicep to the front and connect my chin to my right thumb. My left hip is lower than my right hip; I'm asymmetrical. Keep this position throughout!</li>
<li>Push with my left hand, and walk my feet up towards him, until my whole body is aligned with his Hipline.</li>
<li>Catch his knee underneath my hip. Once I've caught his knee, I release my left hand and move it to his hamstring.</li>
<li>The I can &ldquo;carry&rdquo; his legs back to the centerline.</li>
<li>Bring my left foot forward and post tightly against his leg. Then Backstep my right leg out.
<ul>
<li>I may need to straighten my right leg first and Windshield wiper.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bring right knee as wedge underneath his knee. Follow if I must.</li>
<li>Take left hand to control his head, gripping behind his neck. Pull him into me to finish the pass.
<ul>
<li>Alternative: I can bring my right hand over his far hip and pull his legs back, until my elbow touches my knee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

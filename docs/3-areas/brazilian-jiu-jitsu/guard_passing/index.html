<ol>
<li>Opponent is kneeling, trapping one of my legs between his with a low grip on my gi pants. He has his other arm underneath my far leg, gripping my belt.</li>
<li>Opponent has tripoded up, connected his shoulder to my centerline and placed his head in position. He is attempting to cover my knee.</li>
<li>Opponent has covered my knee and is attempting to reverse / square up, pointing my hips away from him.</li>
<li>Alternative: Opponent is just about to cover my knee, but I have deep / good inside leg position.</li>

<li>Insert Cross Collar grip with far hand to block lead shoulder (hasn't solved far shoulder problem, opp. can shake his head left and right).</li>

<li>As soon as I can, shift a little more out and bring my foot to his shoulder.</li>

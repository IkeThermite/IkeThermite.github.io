      <description>Neural Networks for Calibration: Part 1 Introduction The purpose of this page is track my experiments with using neural networks to move the hard work of model calibration &amp;ldquo;offline&amp;rdquo;.
My primary resource is the 2016 paper by Hernandez, &amp;ldquo;Model Calibration with Neural Networks&amp;rdquo;. This served as the inspiration for a &amp;ldquo;2017 Financial Mathematics Team Challenge Project&amp;rdquo;, which was supervised by Josef Teichman. Finally, in 2018 Nicolau Haussamer wrote &amp;ldquo;Model Calibration with Machine Learning&amp;rdquo; as his short dissertation, in partial fulfillment of his MPhil in Mathematical Finance at the University of Cape Town.</description>
